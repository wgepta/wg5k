title: Willow Glen 5K Courses
---
We aren't running together this year but that doesn't mean we can't run.  Lincoln Avenue won't close for the race, but we can chart our own way, with help from our fellow runners.  

Check back on this page for new courses as they're added.  Not all will be exactly 5K but that's OK.  

### How to share your favorite run.

We'll be posting potential 5K courses all around town.  There are different tools to plot race maps, but we'll be using [PlotARoute](https://www.plotaroute.com/) or [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/). If you feel like submitting a course, please email info@wg5k.org.

Here's an example of the Plotaroute map:
