We want to thank you for your on-going support of the Willow Glen 5k. This event supports so many integral programs at our local schools.

We are keeping a close eye on the city and county guidelines with regard to our race.  We have a green light from both the city of San Jose and Santa Clara County for the 11th annual Willow Glen 5k to take place May 9th. As the information from Public Health continues to come in, we will take every precaution and make adjustments as need to keep our community happy, healthy, and safe.

<strong>We will update this page as soon as any changes are made.</strong>  For additional questions, contact [questions@wg5k.org](mailto:questions@willowglen5k.org)
