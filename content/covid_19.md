---We want to thank you for your on-going support of the Willow Glen 5k. This event supports so many integral programs at our local schools.

We are keeping a close eye on the city and county guidelines with regard to our race. We have decide to move to a virtual race. You can read more about it on our [front page](/)

<strong>We will update this page as soon as any changes are made.</strong> For additional questions, contact [questions@wg5k.org](mailto:questions@willowglen5k.org)
