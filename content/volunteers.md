Volunteers are needed  in varying shifts from 6am – 2pm on race day, {{< param "race_date" >}}. Volunteer needs include: festival setup, registration, kids’ zone helpers, water stations, race course control, medical support, finish line and post-race Festival.

We welcome adults and students, individually or with schools, civic clubs and community organizations to help.
