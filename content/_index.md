 Willow Glen 5K’s flat and USATF-certified race course starts in San Jose’s Willow Glen downtown and winds through neighborhood streets, with racers cheered on by local businesses and residents.
 
 Racers, families and neighbors are then invited to a post-race festival, awards ceremony and kids’ fun zone. Sponsor booths, pancake breakfast, music, games, massage therapy, and a dedicated kids’ area – all spread out over two areas of the Willow Glen Elementary school campus.
 
 Proceeds from the race go to local elementary school PTAs to fund after-school programs such as: arts, music, science, sports, technology and many more.
