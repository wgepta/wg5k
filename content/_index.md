# A message from the race organizer

Let me start by thanking you for your continued support of the Willow Glen 5k Run/Walk for Education. If it wasnâ€™t for racers like you, we would not be able to provide art, science, music, and PE for our area public schools.

If you have any questions, reach out to us at [info@wg5k.org](mailto:info@wg5k.org)

Again, thank you for supporting your community through the Willow Glen 5k!

> Debbie Lewis, Willow Glen 5k Race Director
