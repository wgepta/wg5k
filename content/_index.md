# A message from the race organizer

Let me start by thanking you for your continued support of the Willow Glen 5k Run/Walk for Education. If it wasnâ€™t for racers like you, we would not be able to provide art, science, music, and PE for our area public schools.

With the extra precautions we are all taking as a global society to keep everyone healthy, we have decided to move to a virtual race format.

## What is different

* Each racer is now running a 5k on their own or in small family groups
* You can run your race any day in May
* Race bags will be mailed to your home

## What is the same

* You will still get your race shirt, bib number, and sponsor swag bag
* Running or walking a 5k is a great accomplishment and can be a family activity
* Local schools are still getting the benefit of your participation

We'll be sending out more information about the virtual race in the coming weeks.

We will be mailing out Race Packets weekly starting at the end of April. Be sure to wear your race shirt and bib number when you run your 5k! Take a picture and post it to social media with the hashtag #wg5k2021.

If you have any questions, reach out to us at [info@wg5k.org](mailto:info@wg5k.org)

Again, thank you for supporting your community through the Willow Glen 5k!
