My name is Kristen Brown, and I want to represent our Willow Glen Community on the San Jose Unified School Board. The position I am running for is Trustee Area Three which includes the district schools of Booksin, Ernesto Galarza, Gardner, Hammer Montessori, River Glen, Schallenberger, as well as Willow Glen Elementary, Middle and High Schools.
