### Reach highly-targeted customers and give back to local schools!

The Willow Glen 5K RUN/WALK for Education is a successful volunteer-coordinated community race through the Willow Glen neighborhood of San Jose. This event includes an average of 2,000 participants each year, ranging from recognized local runners to parents pushing strollers. Racers, families and neighbors then join together at the finish line for a post-race festival featuring sponsor signage, booths, pancake breakfast, kid zone, and promotional swag.

As a prominent local business/organization, we would like to invite you to become a sponsor for this year’s race. Sponsorship increases awareness and recognition of your business to parents, local schools and the entire Willow Glen community through promotional materials that reach tens of thousands of local residents. Sponsorship opportunities range from $500 to $5,000 and offer varying degrees of pre-race and race day promotions. Please see the attached flier for details or send mail to **sponsorships@wg5k.org**.

### About the Race

The Willow Glen 5K is a certified, fast and flat course that starts in downtown Willow Glen, at the corner of Lincoln Ave. at Minnesota. The course travels through downtown Willow Glen on Lincoln Ave., winds its way through Willow Glen residential streets and finishes 200 yards from the starting line in the Willow Elementary School courtyard and in front of the post-race festival. Volunteers and police will monitor the cross-traffic at most intersections. Volunteers and community groups will line the race course to cheer racers on and provide entertainment – while providing great visibility for participating sponsors!

For more information, send mail to **sponsorships@wg5k.org**.
